# morejs README

This project is meant to try out body pane implementations for leoInteg

More precisely, is a testbed for trying out solutions for showing a 'body pane' to edit text, switch content elegantly, and block 'undos' from traversing document switches.

The 'More' name is a reference to the history of the Leo Outline Editor, which was inspired by the 'More Outline Editor'

**Enjoy!**
